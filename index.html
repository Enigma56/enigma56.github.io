    <p>My name is Charles Lyster, more commonly Charlie. I am a student at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts.
      My interests are wide-spread including but not limited to Video Games, Photography, and Nature. I love to explore and see
      what the world has to offer. <br><br>

      I've lived in California my entire life before moving to the East Coast for University. Change is something I
      actively think about and tend to seek when it is needed. My page generally explores who I am and is also a front to display my works.
